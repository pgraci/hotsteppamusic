				The vision for Hot Steppa began in St. Thomas, Jamaica, in 2014, when <strong>Phil Hot Steppa</strong>{" "}
				(CEO/DJ/Executive Producer) and <strong>Marcus Chong</strong> (A&amp;R/Producer) envisioned a project
				combining a sound system, record label, apparel line, and event production. Their goal was to create a
				platform that supports selected artists by managing their marketing and producing music and videos.
				Additionally, they aimed to provide the necessary infrastructure for events, and merch and apparel
				sales to fund creative endeavors.
